        <p>This page contains visulizations of some the sorting algorithms used in our PBL.</p>

        <h2><a name="quicksort">Quicksort</a></h2>
        <p><strong>Quicksort</strong> is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that runs in <strong>O(<i>n</i> log <i>n</i>)</strong> time on average, and
            <strong>O(<i>n</i><sup>2</sup>)</strong> time in the worst case. The basic structure of the algorithm is as follows:</p>
        <div class="alg">
            <div class="hdr"><code>QUICKSORT</code>(<span>A</span>):</div>
            <div>If <span>A</span> has fewer than 2 elements:</div>
            <div class="i1">Return A</div>
            <div>Pick a pivot <span>p</span> from <span>A</span></div>
            <div><span>L</span> &larr; <code>QUICKSORT</code>(Things in
                <span>A</span> &le; <span>p</span>)</div>
            <div><span>U</span> &larr; <code>QUICKSORT</code>(Things in
                <span>A</span> &gt; <span>p</span>)</div>
            <div>Return <span>L</span> + [<span>p</span>] + <span>U</span></div>
        </div>
        <p>This algorithm is good for sorting both fixed-size contiguous arrays, as well as arrays built on linked lists (if you are smart about it). It is is also easy to understand, and is generally pretty fast. These all make it an attractive choice for many applications.</p>
        <p>In the following demo, the two solid black bars represent the current region we are partitioning. The orange marked bar represents the pivot value, and the dotted blue lines mark the unpartitioned region. This is a direct translation of the C algorithm in the appendix.</p>
        <div id="quick" class="sort"></div>
        <h2><a name="mergesort">Merge Sort</a></h2>
        <p><strong>Merge sort</strong> is also a divide-and-conquer algorithm that runs in <strong>O(<i>n</i> log <i>n</i>)</strong> time. The algorithm is structured as follows:</p>
        <div class="alg">
            <div class="hdr"><code>MERGE-SORT</code>(<span>A</span>):</div>
            <div>If <span>A</span> has fewer than 2 elements:</div>
            <div class="i1">Return A</div>
            <div><span>L</span> &larr; <code>MERGE-SORT</code>(First half of
                <span>A</span>)</div>
            <div><span>U</span> &larr; <code>MERGE-SORT</code>(Second half of
                <span>A</span>)</div>
            <div>Return <code>MERGE</code>(<span>L</span>, <span>U</span>)</div>
        </div>
        <p>The MERGE operation is not shown here, but it merges two sorted subarrays into a single sorted array. The code for MERGE depends on the exact array implementation used. If arrays are required to be contiguous in memory, then a temporary array to contain the merged array is required. (There is a variant of merge sort that makes in-place merging possible, but it is complex and is not included here). If linked lists are being used, then the MERGE operation is quite simple and requires no extra memory. <strong>Merge sort</strong> is a very popular linked list sorting algorithm for this reason.</p>
        <p>For merge sort, and merge sort only, an additional operation "shift" has been added, which moves a bar down the array and shifts everything in between up one spot. This operation is central to the merge operation. Merge sort is much more appropriate for linked lists, where merging can be done very quickly and without using any extra memory.</p>
        <p>The black bars represent the region that is currently being merged. The blue dashed line marks the boundary between the left and right sorted subarrays. The right subarray is merged into the left one.</p>
        <div id="merge" class="sort"></div>
        <h2><a name="insertsort">Insertion Sort</a></h2>
        <p><strong>Insertion sort</strong> is a very basic sorting algorithm that closely mimics how humans sort things. The typical case has a running time of <strong>O(<i>n</i><sup>2</sup>)</strong>. The basic structure of the algorithm is as follows:</p>
        <div class="alg">
            <div class="hdr"><code>INSERTION-SORT</code>(<span>A</span>):</div>
            <div><span>S</span> &larr; []</div>
            <div>For each <span>e</span> in <span>A</span>:</div>
            <div class="i1">Insert <span>e</span> into <span>S</span> so that it is sorted</div>
            <div>Return <span>S</span></div>
        </div>
        <div id="insert" class="sort"></div>
       
    </div>
